# Collective Mind toolkit

The Collective Mind toolkit (CM or CK2) transforms Git repositories, Docker containers, Jupyter notebooks and zip/tar files
into a collective database of reusable artifacts and automation scripts with a unified interface and extensible meta descriptions.

It is motivated by our tedious experience reproducing [150+ ML and Systems papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpeIVwICa4)
when our colleagues have spent many months analyzing the structure of ad-hoc projects, reproducing results
and [validating them in the real world](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html) 
with different and continuously changing software, hardware, environments, data sets and settings.

That is why we have decided to develop a simple toolkit to help you share your artifacts, knowledge, 
experience and best practices with the world in a more reusable, automated, portable and reproducible way.

The CM toolkit is based on the [Collective Knowledge concept]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01149 )
that was successfully validated in the past few years to 
[enable collaborative ML and Systems R&D](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html),
modularize the [MLPerf inference benchmark](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/docs/mlperf-automation),
and [automate the development and deployment of Pareto-efficient ML Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ldgVZ64hEI).

See a few [related slides](docs/motivation.md) and a related article 
about ["MLOps Is a Mess But That's to be Expected"](https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/mlops-is-a-mess/) (March 2022).

# Research and development

## CM core enhancements

We use [GitHub tickets](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/issues) 
to improve and enhance the CM core based on the feedback from our users!
Please don't hesitate to share your ideas and report encountered issues!

## CM-based automation scripts

* We work with the community to transform R&D projects [from ML and Systems papers](https://cTuning.org/ae) 
  into [reusable CM artifacts and automation scripts](docs/reusable-components.md). 
  Feel free to suggest your own automation recipes to be reused by the community.

## CM-based projects

* [Universal benchmarking of computational systems](docs/projects/universal-benchmarking.md).
* [Towards modular MLPerf benchmark](docs/projects/modular-mlperf.md).
* [MLPerf design space exploration](docs/projects/mlperf-dse.md).
* [Automated deployment of Pareto-efficient ML Systems](docs/projects/production-deployment.md).
