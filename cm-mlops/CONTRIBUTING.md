## Contributing to the MLCommons

The best way to contribute to the MLCommons is to get involved with one of our many project communities. You find more information about getting involved with MLCommons [here](https://mlcommons.org/en/get-involved/#getting-started). 

Generally we encourage people to become a MLCommons member if they wish to contribute to MLCommons projects, but outside pull requests are very welcome too.

Regardless of if you are a member, your organization needs to sign the MLCommons CLA. Please fill out this [CLA sign up form](https://forms.gle/Ew1KkBVpyeJDuRw67) form to get started.

MLCommons project work is tracked with issue trackers and pull requests. Modify the project in your own fork and issue a pull request once you want other developers to take a look at what you have done and discuss the proposed changes. Ensure that cla-bot and other checks pass for your Pull requests.

## Contributing to the MLCommons Collective Mind

We suggest you to join the [open MLCommons taskforce on education and reproducibility](docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md)
to learn how to use the CM framework, enhance existing CM components for MLOps and DevOps, 
run MLPerf benchmarks and contribute your own artifacts, scripts and workflows in the CM format.

Please check this [guide](cm/docs/tutorials/scripts.md#adding-new-artifacts-scripts-and-workflows-to-cm) 
to plug your own artifacts, scripts and workflows into CM.

You can then share CM components in your own Git repository or in the [MLCommons CM repository](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops)
to help the community reuse them and build upon them.

These components must automatically download, install, build and preprocess different applications, models,
data sets, frameworks, compilers, SDKs and tools across different platforms and operating systems
to help the community modularize, simplify, co-design, benchmark, optimize and deploy efficient AI/ML systems.

You are very welcome to provide feedback and report bugs [here](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/issues).

Thank you for your support and looking forward to collaborating with you!
