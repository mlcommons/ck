### Challenge

Prepare, optimize and reproduce MLPerf training v3.0 benchmarks 
using the [MLCommons CM (CK2) automation framework](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck)

Join this public [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JjWNWXKxwT) 
to discuss with the community and organizers 
how to use and enhance CK to run and optimize MLPerf inference benchmarks.

### Status

We could not do a successful submission mainly because the training scripts where not converging on a single GPU. We tried resnet and bert training. The below CM scripts are added to do MLPerf training for BERT using the reference and NVIDIA implementations.
