### Challenge

Check past MLPerf inference results in [this MLCommons repository](https://github.com/mlcommons/cm4mlperf-results)
and add derived metrics such as result/No of cores, power efficiency, device cost, operational costs, etc.

Add clock speed as a third dimension to graphs and improve Bar graph visualization.

Join our public [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JjWNWXKxwT) to discuss this challenge with the organizers.

Read [this documentation](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf/inference/README.md) 
to run reference implementations of MLPerf inference benchmarks 
using the CM automation language and use them as a base for your developments.

Check [this ACM REP'23 keynote](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8105339) to learn more about our open-source project and long-term vision.


### Prizes

* *All contributors will participate in writing a common white paper about running and comparing MLPerf inference benchmarks out-of-the-box.*
* *All contributors will receive 1 point for submitting valid results for 1 complete benchmark on one system.*
* *All contributors will receive an official MLCommons Collective Knowledge contributor award (see [this example](https://ctuning.org/awards/ck-award-202307-zhu.pdf)).*
