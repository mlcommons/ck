This MLCommons CM repository contains portable scripts
in the [CM format](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck) to unify and interconnect 
different MLOps and DevOps tools across continuously changing software, hardware and data.
**See the automatically generated catalog [here](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/list_of_scripts.md).**

All cross-platform СM scripts have a unified API, human readable CLI and extensible JSON/YAML meta description
making it possible to reuse them in different projects and chain them together 
into powerful, efficient and portable automation workflows, applications and web services
adaptable to continuously changing software and hardware.

Check the [CM docs](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/docs) to understand
the CM concept, install the CM tool and reuse portable CM scripts for MLOps and DevOps.

Join the [open MLCommons taskforce on education and reproducibility](../docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md) 
to learn how to make ML Systems more portable, reproducible and reusable 
across rapidly evolving SW/HW stacks, and automate their benchmarking, optimization, 
design space exploration and deployment.
