# Collective Mind meta-framework

Collective Mind (CM) is a cross-platform automation meta-framework 
that provides a simple way to unify, manage, connect and reuse any artifacts, scripts, tools and workflows 
on any platform with any software and hardware stack. 

CM is being developed by the [open MLCommons taskforce on education and reproducibility](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md)
to modularize ML and AI systems and automate their benchmarking, 
optimization, design space exploration and deployment 
across continuously changing software, hardware and data.

# News

* We keep our news and weekly notes at this [public doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zMNK1m_LhWm6jimZK6YE05hu4VH9usdbKJ3nBy-ZPAw/edit).

* **2022 September 9:** Subscribe to our [public workgroup](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md) 
  to participate in the development of automation workflows
  to simplify, modularize and automate ML Systems benchmarking.

* **2022 September 1:** We have developed a CM workflow to automate and modularize 
  [MLPerf inference benchmark](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf-cm-automation-demo.md).
  We continue these developments within a public [MLPerf education and reproducibility workgroup](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/docs/mlperf-education-workgroup.md).

* **2022 July 25:** We updated tutorial about CM scripts: https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/cm/docs/tutorial-scripts.md .

* **2022 July 21:** We have pre-released relatively stable scripts for portable DevOps and MLOps at https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/script .

* **2022 May 20:** We brainstormed the minimal set of [portable CM scripts](https://cknowledge.org/docs/cm/tutorial-scripts.html) to automate deployment of ML models across diverse hardware and software at [OctoML](https://OctoML.ai) in Seattle, WA.

* **2022 April 3:** We presented our approach to bridge the growing gap between ML Systems research and production 
  at the HPCA'22 workshop on [benchmarking deep learning systems](https://sites.google.com/g.harvard.edu/mlperf-bench-hpca22/home).

* **2022 March:** We were invited to present our concept to [enable collaborative and reproducible ML Systems R&D](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=73126) 
  at the SIAM'22 workshop on "Research Challenges and Opportunities within Software Productivity, Sustainability, and Reproducibility"

* **2022 March:** We have released the first prototype of [the Collective Mind toolkit (aka CK2)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm)
  based on your feedback and our practical experience [reproducing 150+ ML and Systems papers and validating them in the real world](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/reproducibility).
