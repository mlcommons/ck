### Contributing to the MLCommons

The best way to contribute to the MLCommons is to get involved with one of our many project communities. 
You find more information about getting involved with MLCommons [here](https://mlcommons.org/en/get-involved/#getting-started). 

Generally we encourage people to become a MLCommons member if they wish to contribute to MLCommons projects, 
but outside pull requests are very welcome too.

Regardless of if you are a member, your organization needs to sign the MLCommons CLA. 
Please fill out this [CLA sign up form](https://forms.gle/Ew1KkBVpyeJDuRw67) form to get started.

MLCommons project work is tracked with issue trackers and pull requests. 
Modify the project in your own fork and issue a pull request once you want other developers 
to take a look at what you have done and discuss the proposed changes. 
Ensure that cla-bot and other checks pass for your Pull requests.
