## Introduction

Designing deep tech systems (ML, AI, Quantum, IoT) and moving them to production
is a very tedious and time-consuming process due to continuously 
changing models, data sets, software and hardware.

The Collective Knowledge project (CK) is our attempt to develop a common SDK
and an [open repository of knowledge]( https://cKnowledge.io ) 
to share [deep tech components]( https://cKnowledge.io/browse ) 
and [R&D automation actions]( https://cKnowledge.io/actions ) 
in a human-readable format 
with a unified CLI, JSON API, and JSON meta descriptions.

Our idea is to abstract and connect different evolving software and hardware
into [portable and non-virtualized (bare-metal) benchmarking "solutions"]( https://cKnowledge.io/solutions )
with [public SOTA scoreboards]( https://cKnowledge.io/results )
to collaboratively benchmark and optimize deep tech systems 
in terms of speed, accuracy, energy and other costs
with the help of the community similar to SETI@home.

We hope that the unified APIs and meta descriptions of such functional CK solutions 
will make it possible to better understand [what is happening]( https://cknowledge.io/solution/demo-obj-detection-coco-tf-cpu-benchmark-linux-portable-workflows/#dependencies ) 
inside "black box" deep tech systems,
integrate them with production and legacy systems,
use them inside Docker and Kubernetes,
share them along with [published and reproduced papers](https://cKnowledge.io/reproduced-papers)
and bring DevOps principles to deep tech R&D.

Even though this CK SDK is <a href="https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html">stable and used in production</a>,
there is still a lot to be done and we are only at the beginning of this long-term project. 
Please check our [MLPerf automation demo](https://cKnowledge.io/demo)
and feel free to [get in touch](https://cKnowledge.org/contacts.html) if you have any feedback and suggestions!
Learn more about our project in the [CK documentation](https://cKnowledge.io/docs) 
and the following presentations and white papers: 
[2019]( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2556147 ),
[2018]( https://cknowledge.io/c/report/rpi3-crowd-tuning-2017-interactive ),
[2017]( https://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/enabling-open-and-reproducible-computer-systems-research-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly ),
[2009]( https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00436029v2 ).


*Note that the CK framework is a low-level and no so user-friendly SDK. That is why we are also developing a more user-friendly wrapper around CK ([cBrain](https://github.com/cknowledge/cbrain)) and a [CK GUI](https://cKnowledge.io/demo).*


## Open knowledge portal

* [cKnowledge.io](https://cKnowledge.io): the open portal with stable CK components, workflows, reproduced papers, and SOTA scoreboards for deep tech systems (AI,ML,quantum,IoT):
  * [Browse SOTA scoreboards powered by CK workflows](https://cKnowledge.io/reproduced-results)
  * [Browse all deep tech CK components](https://cKnowledge.io/browse)
  * [Search for reusable CK components](https://cKnowledge.io)
* [Our reproducibility initiatives for systems and ML conferences](https://cTuning.org/ae)




## CK use cases

* [Real world use cases from our industrial and academic partners](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html)
* [MLPerf benchmark automation demo with a CK SOTA scoreboard](https://cKnowledge.io/demo)
* [Demo of a CK-based live research paper (collaboration with the Raspberry Pi foundation)](https://cKnowledge.io/report/rpi3-crowd-tuning-2017-interactive).

## Installation

Follow [this guide](https://cKnowledge.io/docs/getting-started/ck-installation.html) 
to install the CK SDK on your platform.

Check [CK-based demo](https://cKnowledge.io/demo) to participate in reproducible MLPerf benchmarking
with a [public SOTA scoreboard](https://cknowledge.io/c/result/sota-mlperf-object-detection-v0.5-crowd-benchmarking).

CK supports the following platforms:

|               | As a host platform | As a target platform |
|---------------|:------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Generic Linux | ✓ | ✓ |
| Linux (Arm)   | ✓ | ✓ |
| Raspberry Pi  | ✓ | ✓ |
| MacOS         | ✓ | ± |
| Windows       | ✓ | ✓ |
| Android       | ± | ✓ |
| iOS           | TBD | TBD |




## Get involved

* This is an ongoing community project and there is a lot to be improved - 
  don't hesitate to [get in touch](https://cKnowledge.org/contacts.html)
  using our slack, mailing list, twitter and email
  if you have any feedback or would like to collaborate.

* Check this [outdated guide](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki) to add your workflows and components. 
  We are gradually rewriting [this guide](https://cKnowledge.io/docs) with our limited resources
  and developing a [CK wrapper (cBrain)](https://github.com/cknowledge/cbrain) to simplify
  the user experience and provide a CK GUI at the [open cKnowledge.io platform](https://cKnowledge.io).
