## Introduction

We have developed the Collective Knowledge framework (CK) to help researchers 
share their projects and artifacts (code, data, models, scripts, experiments, papers)
in a common format as a human-readable database with a standardized API, CLI and JSON input/output/meta descriptions.

CK is a small, cross-platform, CLI-based and community-driven Python framework 
to add, share and reuse [automation actions](https://cKnowledge.io/actions) 
for repetitive, tedious, and time-consuming R&D tasks in a non-intrusive way
along with existing research projects.


CK also helps to convert all ad-hoc artfiacts into standardized and reusable CK components 
with a common API and JSON meta description.
For example, CK features 
[software detection plugins](https://cKnowledge.io/soft) (CK "soft" component), 
[meta packages](https://cKnowledge.io/packages) (CK "package" component) 
and [OS descriptions](https://cKnowledge.io/c/os)
to automate the detection and installation of all the dependencies 
required by a given research project to run on any target platform.

Such CK actions and components can be connected into platform-agnostic, 
portable, customizable, reusable and reproducible [workflows](https://cKnowledge.io/programs) 
(CK "program" component) that can be easily integrated with Continuous Integration tools, 
existing/legacy projects, and production systems.

The stable components are published at the [open Collective Knowledge platform](https://cKnowledge.io)
similar to PyPI along with auto-generated "live" papers and portable workflows 
to help the community participate in [collaborative validation of research results](https://cKnowledge.io/results) 
across diverse hardware, datasets and models similar to SETI@home.

Our long-term goal is to enable collaborative, reproducible, sustainable and production-ready research 
based on DevOps principles.

## Important features

* CK actions can be shared and reused across research projects:
  see the [list of available actions and modules](https://cKnowledge.io/modules).

* Standardized CK APIs and meta-descriptions help  users 
  to easily connect actions into automated, portable and customizable workflows, 
  and quickly integrate them with practically all major tools, frameworks and Continuous Integration Services: 
  see the [list of shared repositories with CK workflows and actions](https://cKnowledge.io/repos).

* CK helps to automate [Artifact Evaluation](https://cTuning.org/ae), 
  perform [reproducible experiments](https://cKnowledge.io/results) 
  and generate papers with reusable research components:
  see [the list of articles with CK workflows](https://cKnowledge.io/?q=%22reproduced-papers%22) 
  and the [CK-based interactive report with the Raspberry Pi foundation](https://cKnowledge.io/report/rpi3-crowd-tuning-2017-interactive).

* CK is used in reproducible optimization competitions to co-design efficient software and hardware
  for emerging AI, ML and quantum computing workloads in terms of speed, accuracy, energy, and costs: 
  see the [live CK dashboard with results from different Hackathons, tournaments and crowd-tuning campaigns](https://cKnowledge.io/results).

## Documentation

*We plan a major revision of the CK documentation in 2020 based on user-feedback*

* [CK wiki](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki) - we plan to rewrite it in the Sphinx format 
* [CK basics](https://michel.steuwer.info/About-CK)
* [CK Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/First-steps)





## Installation

You can install the Collective Knowledge framework on most platforms using PIP as follows:

```
pip install ck
```

You can also install CK using a specific Python version (for example, Python 3.6 or for Python 2.7):
```
python3.6 -m pip install ck
```
or
```
python2.7 -m pip install ck
```

*You may need to add flag "--user" to install the client in your user space:*
```
pip install ck --user
python3.6 -m pip install ck --user
```

You should now be able to run CK using one of the following alternative commands:
```
ck

python3.6 -m ck
```

If the installation is successful, you will see some internal information 
about the CK installation and a Python version used:

```
CK version: 1.12.1

Python executable used by CK: /usr/bin/python

Python version used by CK: 2.7.12 (default, Oct  8 2019, 14:14:10)
   [GCC 5.4.0 20160609]

### Prerequisites

The CK framework requires minimal dependencies: Python 2.7+ or 3.x, PIP and Git. 

CK supports the following platforms:

|               | As a host platform | As a target platform |
|---------------|:------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Generic Linux | ✓ | ✓ |
| Linux (Arm)   | ✓ | ✓ |
| Raspberry Pi  | ✓ | ✓ |
| MacOS         | ✓ | ✓ |
| Windows       | ✓ | ✓ |
| Android       | partially | ✓ |
| iOS           | TBD | TBD |

### Linux

You need to have the following packages installed (Ubuntu example):

```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip git wget
```

### MacOS

```
brew install python3 python3-pip git wget
```

### Windows

* Download and install Git from [git-for-windows.github.io](https://git-for-windows.github.io).
* Download and install any Python from [www.python.org/downloads/windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows).

### Android (Linux host)

These dependencies are needed to cross-compile for Android (tested on Ubuntu 18.04 including Docker and Windows 10 Subsystem for Linux). 

```
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt install git wget libz-dev curl cmake
 sudo apt install gcc g++ autoconf autogen libtool
 sudo apt install android-sdk
 sudo apt install google-android-ndk-installer
```

### Docker

We prepared several Docker images with the CK framework and AI/ML CK workflows 
at the [cTuning Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ctuning).
Select the most relevant image and run it as follows:
```
docker run -p 3344:3344 -it {Docker image name from the above list} /bin/bash
```






## Next steps

Based on user feedback we plan the following activities:

* Standardization of CK actions, APIs and meta descriptions
* Better documentation
* GUI to create, test and interconnect CK actions
* GUI to assemble portable workflows
* GUI to automate [MLPerf](https://mlperf.org) submissions
