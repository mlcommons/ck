# Introduction to the MLCommons CK playground

[Collective Knowledge playground (MLCommons CK)](https://x.cKnowledge.org)
is a free, open-source and technology-agnostic on-prem platform 
that aggregates [reproducible experiments](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=experiments) 
from the community unified by the [CM language](#collective-mind-language-cm).

CK is intended to connect academia and industry to collaboratively improve reproduced experiments
via [public optimization challenges]( https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/challenge ).

It is being developed by the [MLCommons Task Force on Automation and Reproducibility](taskforce.md)
to help AI and ML users and developers generate Pareto-efficient AI and ML systems and applications
based on their requirements and constraints (optimal trade off between performance, power consumption, accuracy and costs).

See a few real-world examples of using the CK playground powered by the CM language:

- [Organizing reproducibility and optimization challenges](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=challenges&name=57cbc3384d7640f9)
- [Reproducing MLPerf inference benchmark and automating submissions](https://cKnowledge.org/mlperf-inference-gui)
- [Visualizing and comparing MLPerf inference benchmark results](https://access.cKnowledge.org/playground/?action=experiments&tags=mlperf-inference,all,open,edge,image-classification,singlestream)
- [Sharing reproducibility reports]( https://cKnowledge.org/mlperf-inf-v3.0-reproducibility-report )
- [Adding derived metrics such as power efficiency and/or cost efficiency]( https://cKnowledge.org/mlcommons-inference-gui )
