# MLPerf benchmark automation demo

We collaborate with the [MLPerf benchmarking consortium](https://mlperf.org)
to automate the manual and tedious process of creating MLPerf inference 
benchmarks and submitting results.

We have prepared a [demo](https://cKnowledge.io/solution/demo-obj-detection-coco-tf-cpu-benchmark-linux-portable-workflows)
of the open-source CK solution  for the object detection application from the MLPerf inference benchmark 
based on SSD-Mobilenets, TensorFlow and COCO data-set.

Please follow the instructions from above page to install the open-source client 
with the unified API to automatically build, run and validate 
this solution on your machine.

You should be able to reproduce some of the latest 
[MLPerf inference benchmark results](https://mlperf.org/inference-results)
from this [research paper](https://cKnowledge.io/c/lib/d0e50ebb5b9d4ec9),
participate in crowd-benchmarking and compare your results against the official ones using 
this [live SOTA scoreboard](https://cKnowledge.io/result/sota-mlperf-object-detection-v0.5-crowd-benchmarking).

You can also check the [live demo](https://cKnowledge.io/solution/demo-obj-detection-coco-tf-cpu-webcam-linux-azure/#test) 
of this solution using the webcam in your browser:
