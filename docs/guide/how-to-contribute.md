# How to contribute

* This is an ongoing community project and there is a lot to be improved - 
  don't hesitate to [get in touch](https://cKnowledge.org/contacts.html)
  using our slack, mailing list, twitter and email
  if you have any feedback or would like to collaborate.

* Check this [outdated guide](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki) to add your workflows and components. 
  We are gradually rewriting [this guide](https://cKnowledge.io/docs) with our limited resources
  and developing a [CK wrapper (cBrain)](https://github.com/cknowledge/cbrain) to simplify
  the user experience and provide a CK GUI at the [open cKnowledge.io platform](https://cKnowledge.io).
