# CK commands

We plan to rewrite this documentation when we have more resources. 
In the mean time have a look at this older wiki-based documentation:

* [CK basics](https://michel.steuwer.info/About-CK)
* [CK Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/First-steps)
* [Contributing to CK](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Adding-new-workflows)
* [CK wiki](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki)
