## Generate actual submission tree

You should use the master branch of MLCommons inference repo for the submission checker:

```bash
cmr "generate inference submission" \
--clean \
--preprocess_submission=yes \
--run-checker \
--submitter=CTuning \
--tar=yes \
--env.CM_TAR_OUTFILE=submission.tar.gz \
--division=open \
--category=edge \
--env.CM_DETERMINE_MEMORY_CONFIGURATION=yes \
--quiet
```

* Use `--division=closed` to generate a closed division result
* Use `--category=datacenter` to generate results for datacenter category
* Use `--hw_notes_extra` option to add your name to the notes like `--hw_notes_extra="Result taken by NAME" `
* Use `--hw_name="My system name"` to give a meaningful system name. Examples can be seen [here](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference_results_v3.0/tree/main/open/cTuning/systems)
* Use `--submitter=<Your name>` if your organization is an official MLCommons member and would like to submit under your organization

The above command should generate "submission.tar.gz" if there are no submission checker issues and you can upload it to the 

## Upload your results

### Push the results to GitHub repo (Only if you are submitting public results under cTuning)

1. First, create a fork of [this repo](https://github.com/ctuning/mlperf_inference_submissions_v4.0).
2. If you have not set up GIT config already please do
    ```
    git config --global user.name "[YOUR NAME]"
    git config --global user.email "[YOUR EMAIL]"
    ```
3. Then run the following command after **replacing `--repo_url` with your fork URL**.

```
cmr "push github mlperf inference submission" \
--repo_url=https://github.com/ctuning/mlperf_inference_submissions_v4.0 \
--commit_message="Results on <HW name> added by <Name>" \
--quiet
```

Create a PR to the [cTuning repo](https://github.com/ctuning/mlperf_inference_submissions_v3.1)

### Upload the tarball to MLPerf UI (Only if your organization is an official MLCommons member)

You can upload the `submission.tar.gz` file generated by the previous command to the [submission UI](https://submissions-ui.mlcommons.org/index).
