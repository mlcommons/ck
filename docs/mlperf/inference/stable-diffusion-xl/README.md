Please check [MLPerf inference GitHub](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference) for more details.

### Run using the [MLCommons CM framework](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck)

*From Feb 2024, we suggest you to use [this GUI](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=howtorun&bench_uid=39877bb63fb54725)
 to configure MLPerf inference benchmark, generate CM commands to run it across different implementations, models, data sets, software
 and hardware, and prepare your submissions.*

### A few ready-to-use CM commands

Install MLCommons CM automation framework with automation recipes for MLPerf as described [here](../../../installation.md).

The following guides explain how to run different implementations of this benchmark via CM:
