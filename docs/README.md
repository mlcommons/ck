# MLCommons CK and CM documentation

The Collective Knowledge project consists of two sub-projects 
to facilitate reproducible research and transfer to production 
across rapidly evolving models, software, hardware and data
[Collective Mind language (MLCommons CM)](#collective-mind-language-cm) 
and
[Collective Knowledge platform (MLCommons CK)](#collective-knowledge-playground-ck).

## Collaborative CM and CK development

This open-source technology is being developed by the open
[MLCommons task force on automation and reproducibility](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/taskforce.md)
led by [Grigori Fursin](https://cKnowledge.org/gfursin) and
[Arjun Suresh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjunsuresh):
